# Goal
In this series of practices, we will go through the theory and concepts of different types of classification along with the applications by using Python.

## Algorithm type
Below are the different types of the machine learning algorithms:

#### Prediction
  - Supervised
    - Continuous variables: Regression
      - Gradient Descent
      - Gradient Ascent
    - Discrete variables: Classification
      - kNN
      - Decision Tree
      - Random Forest
#### Explore
  - Unsupervised
     - Fit data into discrete groups: Clustering
       - Agglomerative
       - Divisive

# Classification
We will go through the theory and applications of different types of classification.

## k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
